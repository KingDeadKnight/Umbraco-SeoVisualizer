# Seo Visualizer
Seo Visualizer is a simple property editor for Umbraco used to take seo-related user input and visualize the page in the Google search results for the editor.

### Features
The property editor just shows a form with two fields

* **Page title** Shows a hint for the user if the title is longer than 70 chars which is not good.
* **Meta description** Shows a hint for the user if the title is longer than 155 chars which is not good. 
* **Title Suffix** Can be configured so titles will be rendered like eg `My Page | Umbraco`
* **No index-toggle** Can be configured to be shown next to the seo-settings.

While typing in the textboxes a preview of the Google snippet is shown in the backoffice.
